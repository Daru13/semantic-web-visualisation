    <section>
        We built a library to help developers working with semantic web data to better visualise the structure, the theme and some statistical properties of SPARQL query responses (tables containing many <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s). Our contribution is twofold:
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                we enhance the representation of the data table returned by a SPARQL query;
            </li>
            <li>
                we offer two visualisations to illustrate URI structures and themes.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Enhancing the data table</h2>
        
        We started by improving the representation of URIs in the data table.
        We chose to hide the repetitive parts (such as the protocol) and to highlight the most meaningful ones for our target audience: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                the <strong>domain</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> the name of the website;
            </li>
            <li>
                the <strong>country</strong> as a flag, when available. We attempt to extract it from the URI by using different heuristics based on common URI patterns;
            </li>
            <li>
                the <strong>path</strong>, which appears to usually describe what is the pointed resource. We highlight the structure the path by colouring slashes (which separate the different parts of the path) and almost hiding underscores (which usually act as whitespace).
            </li>
        </ul>

        We then added <strong>dashboards</strong> at the top of each column.
        They display basics statistics about the content of the column and allow to open more advanced visualisations, described below.
    </section>

        <h2>Visusalising themes and URI structures</h2>
        
        <p>
            Working with the semantic web means manipulating a lot of URIs, and SPARQL responses do seem to contain lots of them.
            In order to help developers to better understand how they are structured and what are the themes they revolve around, we created two dedicated visualisations:
        </p>

        <p>
            The second one is a Sankey diagram. It has three main columns: the subdomain, the domain plus tld and the path columns. For each elements of those columns (for example wikipedia.org), the more URIs with that element, the thicker and the more saturated the visual representation is. For two elements from two of those columns (for example dbpedia.org and ressource), the more URIs with both elements, the thicker and the more saturated the link between those two elements is. If one can understand how the URIs from on website are structured, one can understand how the website is structured.
        </p>
    </section>

        <h2>Demo</h2>
        
        Here are some demos of our library on different SPARQL queries:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The first one is a <strong>word cloud</strong>.
                    It is displaying the keywords of a column organized from the most present to the least. A keywords is either the last part of the path of an URI, <em>i.e.</em> the name of the webpage, or keywords extracted from textual cells using regular expressions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This visualisations allows to understand the dominant theme in a column. For example, in <a href="demo1.html">demo 1</a>, for the genre column, we can read the most present genres of music in the database.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The second one is a <strong>Sankey diagram</strong>.
                    It has three main columns: the subdomain, the domain with the domain extension (TLD), and the path.
                    For each elements of those columns (such as <span class="code">wikipedia.org</span>), the more URIs with that element, the thicker and darker the visual representation is. For two elements from two of those columns (for example <span class="code">dbpedia.org</span> and <span class="code">resource</span>), the more URIs with both elements, the thicker and darker the link between those two elements is.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Demo pages</h2>

        <p>
            Given the beta status and the requirements for using <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/rest-api">dbpedia's REST API</a>, and given the limited time we had, we did not build any form for visualising the response of any SPARQL query.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, we uploaded a few demos based on SPARQL reponses obtained via dbpedia's SPARQL query runner. We used responses with different numbers of rows and/or columns in order to illustrate the robustness of our library.
