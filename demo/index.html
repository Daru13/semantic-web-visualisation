    <section>
        We built a library to help developers working with semantic web data to better visualise the structure, the theme and some statistical properties of SPARQL query responses (tables containing many <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s). We based our work on SPARQL responses from <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/">dbpedia.org</a> (<em>i.e.</em> from data looking like <a href="http://fr.dbpedia.org/sparql?default-graph-uri=&query=select+distinct+%3FConcept+where+%7B%5B%5D+a+%3FConcept%7D+LIMIT+100&format=text%2Fhtml&timeout=0&debug=on">this</a>), and our contribution is twofold:

            <li>
                we propose two specialised visualisations to illustrate URI structures and themes.

        <h2>Enhancing the data table</h2>
        <p>
            We started by improving the representation of URIs in the data table, assuming developers may want to have a look at the actual data returned by a SPARQL query they ran.
            We chose to hide the repetitive parts (such as the protocol) and to highlight the most meaningful ones for our target audience:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                the <strong>domain</strong> of the URI (where is the data located);
            </li>
            <li>
                the <strong>country/language</strong> of the URI as a flag, when we could extract it from the URI;
            </li>
            <li>
                the <strong>path</strong> of the URI (what is the name of this piece of data).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In order to handle very long tables, we decided to <strong>paginate</strong> the table.
            You can use the page browser at the bottom-right hand corner of your screen or the left/right arrow keys to navigate between pages.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also added <strong>dashboards</strong> at the top of each column.
            They display basics statistics about the content of the whole column and contain buttons to display more specific visualisations (described below).
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Visusalising themes and URI structures</h2>
        When studying a column, a developer may want to focus on (1) the main themes of the data and (2) the plurality of the URI structures. We created two dedicated visulisations to help them perform such tasks.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The first one is a <strong>word cloud</strong>.
                    It contains the keywords of a column organized from the most present to the least. A keywords is either the last part of the path or words extracted from textual cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This visualisation allows to understand the dominant theme in a column. For example, in <a href="demo1.html">the first demo</a>, you can easily read the most popular musical genres.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The second one is a <strong>Sankey diagram</strong>.
                    It has three main columns: the subdomain, the domain with the domain extension (TLD), and the path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In each column, the more URIs contain a certain element (<em>e.g.</em> <span class="code">dbpedia.org</span>), the thicker and more saturated it will be. The same applies for the links between two columns: the more two elements appear in the same URIs, the thicker and more saturated the link will be.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Demo pages</h2>

        <p>
            Given the beta status and the requirements for using <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/rest-api">dbpedia's REST API</a>, and given the limited time we had, we did not build a form where you could run any SPARQL query you want to visualise.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, we uploaded a few demos based on SPARQL reponses obtained via dbpedia's <a href="http://fr.dbpedia.org/sparql">SPARQL query runner</a>. We used responses with different numbers of rows and/or columns in order to illustrate the robustness of our library.
        </p>
