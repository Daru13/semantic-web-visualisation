    <section>
        We built a library to help developers working with semantic web data to better visualise the structure, the theme and some statistical properties of SPARQL query responses (tables containing many <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s). We based our work on SPARQL responses from <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/">dbpedia.org</a>, and our contribution is twofold:
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                we enhance the representation of the data table returned by a SPARQL query;
            </li>
            <li>
                we propose two specialised visualisations to illustrate URI structures and themes.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Enhancing the data table</h2>
        <p>
            We started by improving the representation of URIs in the data table, assuming developers may want to have a look at the actual data returned by a SPARQL query they ran.
            We chose to hide the repetitive parts (such as the protocol) and to highlight the most meaningful ones for our target audience:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                the <strong>domain</strong> of the URI (where is the data located);
            </li>
            <li>
                the <strong>country/language</strong> of the URI as a flag, when we could extract it from the URI;
            </li>
            <li>
                the <strong>path</strong> of the URI (what is the name of this piece of data).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In order to handle very long tables, we decided to <strong>paginate</strong> the table.
            You can use the page browser at the bottom-right hand corner of your screen or the left/right arrow keys to navigate between pages.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also added <strong>dashboards</strong> at the top of each column.
            They display basics statistics about the content of the whole column and contain buttons to display more specific visualisations (described below).
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Visusalising themes and URI structures</h2>
        When studying a column, a developer may want to focus in one of the two following directions: the main theme of the cells and the plurality of the URI structures. We created two dedicated visulisations to help them perform such tasks. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The first one is a <strong>word cloud</strong>.
                    It is displaying the keywords of a column organized from the most present to the least. A keywords is either the last part of the path of an URI, <em>i.e.</em> the name of the webpage, or keywords extracted from textual cells using regular expressions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This visualisations allows to understand the dominant theme in a column. For example, in <a href="demo1.html">demo 1</a>, for the genre column, we can read the most present genres of music in the database.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The second one is a <strong>Sankey diagram</strong>.
                    It has three main columns: the subdomain, the domain with the domain extension (TLD), and the path.
                    For each elements of those columns (such as <span class="code">wikipedia.org</span>), the more URIs with that element, the thicker and darker the visual representation is. For two elements from two of those columns (for example <span class="code">dbpedia.org</span> and <span class="code">resource</span>), the more URIs with both elements, the thicker and darker the link between those two elements is.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Demo pages</h2>

        <p>
            Given the beta status and the requirements for using <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/rest-api">dbpedia's REST API</a>, and given the limited time we had, we did not build a form where you could run any SPARQL query you want to visualise.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, we uploaded a few demos based on SPARQL reponses obtained via dbpedia's <a href="http://fr.dbpedia.org/sparql">SPARQL query runner</a>. We used responses with different numbers of rows and/or columns in order to illustrate the robustness of our library.
        </p>
